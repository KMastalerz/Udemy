<app-server *ngFor="let server of servers"></app-server>
<!-- If you're in an Angular 17 project (and only then!), you can also use an alternative syntax for outputting conditional content:

Instead of using *ngFor, you can use a built-in @for template control flow statement.

@for (item of items; track item.id) {
  <li>{{ item.title }}</li>
}
would replace

<li *ngFor="let item of items">{{ item.title }}</li>
The advantage of the new syntax is that it can be slightly more efficient under the hood and that it does not rely on NgFor or the CommonModule being imported / available.

The track item.id part is required when using this new syntax - it ensures that Angular can efficiently track and re-render (if needed) the list items.

Using it is entirely optional! It's also worth noting that this new syntax is only available in "Developer Preview" right now and therefore may change in the future!

You can learn more about this syntax here. And I'll share more details in an upcoming course update (which you'll get for free & which I'll announce once it's done) :-) -->
